        <p>Surprisingly, Iran is not completely flat or desert land. 55 percent of Iran is mountainous and more than 100 peaks are higher than 4000 meters.</p>
         <p>Iran’s mountains are divided into four groups: <a href="https://toirantour.com/wonderful-irans-mountains/">Alborz</a> range in the north, <a href="https://toirantour.com/wonderful-irans-mountains/">Zagros</a> chain in the west, Eastern Mountains, and central ones. There are some volcanic peaks like Damavand, Sabalan, Taftan and etc. strange caves and springs and spas have given more beauty to the mountains.</p>
            <p>It’s good to know that evidence of early communities and urban settlements have been found in the Zagros mountains. Therefore, picturesque nature and also the cultural and historical attraction of Iranian mountains are considerable. The following table shows the twenty highest of Iran’s mountains. It’s a brief list and lots of mountains can be added to it. By the way Kuh in the Persian means mountain.</p>
